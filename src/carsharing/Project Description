Using H2 embedded database, the goal was to create a car rental service that had various companies.
Each company had its own list of cars that could be rent by customers.
The databased contained tables that were linked using a foreign key.
This was my first attempt at using any sort of database with Java programming.

The menu system used can be some what confusing to understand from the code because the task requires
jumping back and forth between various menus.
